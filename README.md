> **A feature-rich, production-ready Discord bot for community engagement, support tickets, entertainment, and powerful moderation tools.**

Eigen Bot is an all-in-one Discord bot designed for thriving communities.

## Command Types

Eigen Bot supports **hybrid commands** - both prefix and slash commands:

- **Prefix Commands** (Legacy): `?command` (e.g., `?dailyquest`, `?helpmenu`)
  - Most commands use prefix commands for backward compatibility
  - Fast, familiar, and don't require slash command permissions
  
- **Slash Commands** (Modern): `/command` (e.g., `/help`, `/timestamp`)
  - Selected commands available as slash commands for modern Discord experience
  - Auto-complete and built-in Discord UI
  - Limited to essential commands to stay within Discord's 100 command limit

** Tip**: Use `?helpmenu` or `/help` to explore all available commands!
